All right, so let's get into today's topic.
13:05
13 minutes 5 seconds
We will discuss about auto insurance in in further details.
13:10
13 minutes 10 seconds
We talked about auto insurance several times.
13:13
13 minutes 13 seconds
We'll talk get into more details.
21:22
21 minutes 22 seconds
What?
21:22
21 minutes 22 seconds
What are the two things they check helmet and then experience?
21:36
21 minutes 36 seconds
You are not.
21:36
21 minutes 36 seconds
Drink and drive.
21:38
21 minutes 38 seconds
Drink and drive.
21:38
21 minutes 38 seconds
Correct.
21:44
21 minutes 44 seconds
Papers.
21:47
21 minutes 47 seconds
Sorry.
21:48
21 minutes 48 seconds
Papers.
21:48
21 minutes 48 seconds
Sorry.
21:50
21 minutes 50 seconds
Insurance papers.
21:52
21 minutes 52 seconds
Yeah, that is what I'm expecting.
21:54
21 minutes 54 seconds
Yeah.
21:54
21 minutes 54 seconds
Insurance papers and license.
21:56
21 minutes 56 seconds
Valid license, right?
21:58
21 minutes 58 seconds
These are the two things, three important things they commonly ask for.
22:02
22 minutes 2 seconds
And of course helmet and drunk and drive cases that they.
22:08
22 minutes 8 seconds
I mean helmet is very obvious.
22:09
22 minutes 9 seconds
Drunk and drive they do buy based on suspicious cases.
22:14
22 minutes 14 seconds
They don't check everybody for drunk and driving, but helmet this is very visible.
22:22
22 minutes 22 seconds
So they do that and they stop to check for two important papers.
22:26
22 minutes 26 seconds
One is license and the other is insurance papers.
22:33
22 minutes 33 seconds
So just because government made it mandatory, these are being checked and if people are who are careless about these two things, penalty is being levied for them.
22:45
22 minutes 45 seconds
So now tell me why it is made mandatory?
22:51
22 minutes 51 seconds
How many of you have paid penalty for not having these papers?
23:01
23 minutes 1 second
Share your story.
23:02
23 minutes 2 seconds
Honestly, I paid penalty once, not for having.
23:09
23 minutes 9 seconds
I mean I had all the papers but I didn't wear my seat belt once and second time for over speeding.
23:21
23 minutes 21 seconds
Give me one second team.
23:23
23 minutes 23 seconds
I have to take this call.
30:14
30 minutes 14 seconds
I'm back team.
30:15
30 minutes 15 seconds
Sorry.
30:19
30 minutes 19 seconds
So we talked about why it is mandatory, right?
30:30
30 minutes 30 seconds
Did anybody Google?
30:30
30 minutes 30 seconds
Meanwhile, did you check for answers why vehicle insurance is mandatory?
30:39
30 minutes 39 seconds
So Anita, so when we we are driving our vehicle, so when we are making accident to another person or another vacant, so they are.
30:49
30 minutes 49 seconds
If they if they are claiming some amount, we should be in the financial position.
30:54
30 minutes 54 seconds
So that party insurance is giving that production.
Excellent excellent, good, good answer and the right answer as well.
31:03
31 minutes 3 seconds
May I know who this is?
31:08
31 minutes 8 seconds
Shankarvel.
31:09
31 minutes 9 seconds
Shankarvel.
31:10
31 minutes 10 seconds
OK, good answer Shankarvel.
31:13
31 minutes 13 seconds
So we need to have the financial position to meet the see see if in accidentally.
55:48
55 minutes 48 seconds
Insurance company will parallely get the MVR report from DMV department of motor vehicles.
55:54
55 minutes 54 seconds
There if they say two accidents and one violation, insurance company will take that as the final report.
56:02
56 minutes 2 seconds
So there is these.
56:03
56 minutes 3 seconds
These are third party data service providers.
56:06
56 minutes 6 seconds
So we get online the MVR report for every driver while issuing a vehicle insurance policy.
56:13
56 minutes 13 seconds
So insurance company gets these details.
56:18
56 minutes 18 seconds
So in this way they are getting accurate information.
56:22
56 minutes 22 seconds
Even if I lie in the application form, I don't disclose correctly.
56:28
56 minutes 28 seconds
They make it out by from the data available from third party data service provider.
56:37
56 minutes 37 seconds
So MVR will what will MVR?
56:40
56 minutes 40 seconds
What information will MVR provide?
56:43
56 minutes 43 seconds
It provides a incident history, how many accidents I have made in May.
56:48
56 minutes 48 seconds
So based on the driving license number, the insurance company will send it to him DMV.
56:53
56 minutes 53 seconds
They will return back with the list of accidents, number of accidents three or two or one or zero.
57:02
57 minutes 2 seconds
So that will be given by the DMV to back to insurance companies and that will be used.
57:08
57 minutes 8 seconds
That information will be used by insurance company to assess the risk and desire whether to accept it or not or reject it.
57:15
57 minutes 15 seconds
It is one of the underwriting considerations.
57:21
57 minutes 21 seconds
So apart from the regular, the three coverages that I told you, liability coverage to passengers and coverage to vehicles, these are other optional coverage that are offered by insurance companies and they the insured can pay additional premium and buy these coverages.
57:42
57 minutes 42 seconds
For every coverage that additionally added, there is a separate form attached to the policy explaining what is that additional coverage and how how it will be applied in the case of claims.
57:59
57 minutes 59 seconds
All right, so there are there are just two more slides we'll finish.
58:09
58 minutes 9 seconds
These are there's a policy life cycle.
58:12
58 minutes 12 seconds
So what?
58:13
58 minutes 13 seconds
What is the different stages of policy will travel, The policy becomes active and we issue a policy, new new policy and then any changes to the policy during the term.
58:26
58 minutes 26 seconds
When I say changes, you could add another driver to the to the policy or you could add another vehicle and driver to your policy or remove a vehicle because you're selling it off, you want to remove it from the insurance policy.
58:39
58 minutes 39 seconds
You can remove it or you want to remove a driver, add a new driver, then you can add it.
58:47
58 minutes 47 seconds
You All of these changes to the policy after issuing the policy can be done through adjustments or policy change.
58:55
58 minutes 55 seconds
That transaction's called a policy adjustment or policy change.
59:00
59 minutes
After the period of 12 months, mostly to wake insurance is 12 months.
59:08
59 minutes 8 seconds
Some places it is issued for six months.
59:11
59 minutes 11 seconds
So after the term, it expires, right?
59:13
59 minutes 13 seconds
And unless it is renewed, if it is renewed, the status is renewed, otherwise it is expired.
59:20
59 minutes 20 seconds
And then during the term of the policy, at the request of the insured or the insurance company, the policy can be cancelled.
59:29
59 minutes 29 seconds
And if it is cancelled?
59:32
59 minutes 32 seconds
If it is cancelled in the seventh month 70 close to 70% of the premium will be retained and remaining 30% will be refunded to the policy holder.
59:46
59 minutes 46 seconds
OK, so cancellation insurance company can cancel a policy on two basis.
59:53
59 minutes 53 seconds
One is either premiums are not paid in time even not even in the grace period, then the policy can be cancelled premiums.
0:03
1 hour 3 seconds
The coverage will be retained only for the period the premiums was paid.
1:00:07
1 hour 7 seconds
And second reason if it it is discovered that the insure.
1:00:11
1 hour 11 seconds
Insured is using the vehicle for an illegal purpose or the vehicle was purchased using illegal means.
1:00:18
1 hour 18 seconds
Then the policy will be cancelled by the insurance company if it is cancelled because of non payment of premium and after cancellation within the within few days say within seven days, the premiums are paid by the policy holder then it will be reinstated.
1:00:38
1 hour 38 seconds
The policy will be reinstated which means policy will go back to active status that is called reason.
1:00:46
1 hour 46 seconds
And reason can be done only within the given number of days, seven days or something.
1:00:52
1 hour 52 seconds
And lastly cancel rewrite.
1:00:55
1 hour 55 seconds
So I issue insurance company issued a policy today but by mistake that start date of the policy is mentioned as tomorrow.
1:01:03
1 hour 1 minute 3 seconds
But I want the coverage from next week onwards.
1:01:06
1 hour 1 minute 6 seconds
Because I already have my older policy, I want to change the start date.
1:01:11
1 hour 1 minute 11 seconds
So changing the start date cannot be done through policy endorsement or adjustment, It has to be cancelled and rewritten.
1:01:21
1 hour 1 minute 21 seconds
So cancel and rewrite will enable cancel the policy, copying the policy again and editing only what that we need to change and then reissue it.
1:01:31
1 hour 1 minute 31 seconds
So cancel rewrite is done only if where certain changes to the policy can cannot be made through policy adjustments.
1:01:39
1 hour 1 minute 39 seconds
Any questions on the policy life cycle?
1:01:44
1 hour 1 minute 44 seconds
No, no questions Good.
1:01:48
1 hour 1 minute 48 seconds
Along with the policy, what are all documents that are attached and issued the time of taking policy?
1:01:55
1 hour 1 minute 55 seconds
The deck page is a main page that is issued declaration.
1:01:58
1 hour 1 minute 58 seconds
We also got as declaration page.
1:02:00
1 hour 2 minutes
It contains who is insured, what is the vehicle insured, Make, model, year, limits, coverages and then it is.
1:02:07
1 hour 2 minutes 7 seconds
It also contains the terms and conditions.
1:02:11
1 hour 2 minutes 11 seconds
Then invoice is a bill so and the vehicle ID cards will be issued.
1:02:17
1 hour 2 minutes 17 seconds
And there are forms that insurance insured has to sign and submit back because of state requirements.
1:02:24
1 hour 2 minutes 24 seconds
OK so description, detailed description then customer notification letter.
1:02:30
1 hour 2 minutes 30 seconds
It consists of customer report and we are these were all requested by insurance company from external data service provider.
1:02:38
1 hour 2 minutes 38 seconds
The copy has to be given to the policy holder for their information.
1:02:44
1 hour 2 minutes 44 seconds
So all of this are attached to the policy.
1:02:47
1 hour 2 minutes 47 seconds
So vehicle ID card in US they they do this and if only for health insurance they issue identity cards, insurance ID cards, vehicle insurance.
1:02:57
1 hour 2 minutes 57 seconds
They issue only insurance policy and certificate of insurance.
