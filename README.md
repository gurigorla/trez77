Got it 👍 I’ll turn this into clean, detailed revision notes that you can use for training + interviews. I’ll also structure it properly since the transcript is a bit scattered.

Auto Application Flow – Detailed Notes

1. Introduction
	•	Trainer: Bhavya
	•	Topic: Auto Application Flow
	•	Session Type: Short introductory session
	•	Purpose:
	•	To give an overview of the Auto Insurance application flow
	•	To help trainees understand system flows before starting coding or policy keying

⸻

2. Overview of Auto Application Flow

The Auto Application Flow is broadly divided into two main types:

2.1 PASS Flow
	•	PASS stands for Policy Administrative System
	•	It is the core system used for:
	•	Policy creation
	•	Policy administration
	•	Managing policy-related transactions

2.2 AIR Flow
	•	AIR stands for Auto Insurance Redesign
	•	It is a newer/redesigned auto insurance application
	•	Focuses on:
	•	Improved architecture
	•	Better handling of auto insurance transactions
	•	Modernized auto insurance flow

📌 Understanding both PASS and AIR is important before working on auto insurance code.

3. Importance of Understanding the Flow
	•	Once you start working on coding, you must:
	•	Understand transactions
	•	Know how data flows through the application
	•	This helps in:
	•	Debugging errors
	•	Identifying issues while coding
	•	Understanding failures during policy processing

For now, the focus is only on understanding the flow, not coding.

4. Auto Policy Keying Process

4.1 Regions Issue
	•	At the time of the session:
	•	Some regions were not working for:
	•	Mobile flow
	•	Member flow
	•	Despite this:
	•	Trainees are encouraged to select any available region
	•	Try keying the policy

⸻

5. Member & Mobile Flow
	•	Member Flow and Mobile Flow are important parts of Auto application
	•	Basic requirements for policy keying were already shared earlier
	•	Trainees are requested to:
	•	Practice keying policies in Member and Mobile flows
	•	Reach out in case of doubts

MSR flow was already covered earlier and assumed to be clear.
