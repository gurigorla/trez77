📘 INSURANCE DOMAIN – DETAILED REVISION NOTES

⸻

1. Principles of Insurance – Insurable Interest

Definition

Insurable interest is the legal and financial relationship between the insured and the subject matter of insurance, where the insured would suffer financial loss if damage or loss occurs.

Why it is important
	•	Prevents insurance from becoming gambling
	•	Avoids fraudulent claims
	•	Ensures insurance is taken only for genuine protection

Key Rule

A person can insure only what they own, possess, or are financially dependent on.

Example discussed in session

Garage owner example:
	•	Garage building is rented → no ownership → cannot insure building
	•	Vehicles, tools, equipment inside → owned by him → can insure those
	•	Shows insurance is valid only to the extent of interest

When insurable interest must exist

Type of Insurance	Timing
Life Insurance	At policy inception
Property Insurance	At time of loss
Motor Insurance	At time of loss
Marine Insurance	At time of loss

Key takeaway

No insurable interest = No valid insurance contract
