	2.	Insured
	•	The person who buys the insurance policy

2. What Is a Claim?
	•	A claim is a request made by the insured to the insurer for compensation.
	•	A claim arises when a loss occurs (accident, damage, theft, etc.).
	•	The insured submits documents, proofs, and bills to support the claim.

Before processing a claim, the claims handler must:
	•	Check whether the coverage is available in the policy

Proximate Cause:
	•	The main and direct cause of the loss
	•	If the proximate cause is covered under the policy, the claim is processed
	•	If not covered, the claim may be rejected immediately

5. Deductible
	•	A deductible is the amount that the insured must bear
	•	It is reduced from the final claim payment

10:25
10 minutes 25 seconds
What is the function of a claim handler?
10:30
10 minutes 30 seconds
They validate the claim of the insurer, correct?
10:37
10 minutes 37 seconds
They validate the claim.
10:38
10 minutes 38 seconds
So what is a claim claiming insurance claiming insure?
10:49
10 minutes 49 seconds
Like if any loss is, yeah, loss is right.
10:54
10 minutes 54 seconds
If a loss occurs, then that that'll be claimed by the insurance insured.
11:00
11 minutes
And when there is a claim, the claim handler verifies the papers identifies fraudulent activities.
11:09
11 minutes 9 seconds
Correct?
11:10
11 minutes 10 seconds
Correct.
11:11
11 minutes 11 seconds
They also identify correct whether the claim is genuine, whether the claim was fraudulent is one thing, and whether whether all the necessary papers are available, The evidence, the proof is submitted and then the estimates, the invoices, all of that would be verified by the handler claims handler and they calculate the actual payment.
11:43
11 minutes 43 seconds
That can be done.
11:44
11 minutes 44 seconds
So there are several rules and processes they have to follow and they also have to follow with the insured for various proof.
11:55
11 minutes 55 seconds
They have to follow with the repairers for bills.
11:58
11 minutes 58 seconds
When they get everything, they calculate the value claim amount to be payable.
12:03
12 minutes 3 seconds
There is something called deductible.
12:05
12 minutes 5 seconds
We'll talk about it in claim session and anything that needs to be reduced from the payment, they will do that and what are all will be reduced.
12:14
12 minutes 14 seconds
We will talk more about that in claim session.
12:17
12 minutes 17 seconds
And finally they settle the payment.
12:20
12 minutes 20 seconds
So basically they verify the whether the coverage is available in the policy.
12:27
12 minutes 27 seconds
So how do we before even identifying whether cover is available, they need to identify the cost of the loss, what is the proximate cost of the loss.
12:35
12 minutes 35 seconds
Remember proximate cost, the principle of insurance.
12:40
12 minutes 40 seconds
So proximate cost has to be identified and if that proximate cost is covered in the policy then they will go ahead in doing the further investigation or further processing of the claim.
12:54
12 minutes 54 seconds
If the proximate cost is not covered, they immediately they they don't analyze much when they recheck the claim.
13:02
13 minutes 2 seconds
All right, so let's get into today's topic.
