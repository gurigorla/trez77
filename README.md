10:49
10 minutes 49 seconds
Like if any loss is, yeah, loss is right.
10:54
10 minutes 54 seconds
If a loss occurs, then that that'll be claimed by the insurance insured.
11:00
11 minutes
And when there is a claim, the claim handler verifies the papers identifies fraudulent activities.
11:09
11 minutes 9 seconds
Correct?
11:10
11 minutes 10 seconds
Correct.
11:11
11 minutes 11 seconds
They also identify correct whether the claim is genuine, whether the claim was fraudulent is one thing, and whether whether all the necessary papers are available, The evidence, the proof is submitted and then the estimates, the invoices, all of that would be verified by the handler claims handler and they calculate the actual payment.
11:43

So there are several rules and processes they have to follow and they also have to follow with the insured for various proof.

12:27
12 minutes 27 seconds
So how do we before even identifying whether cover is available, they need to identify the cost of the loss, what is the proximate cost of the loss.
12:35
12 minutes 35 seconds
Remember proximate cost, the principle of insurance.
12:40
12 minutes 40 seconds
So proximate cost has to be identified and if that proximate cost is covered in the policy then they will go ahead in doing the further investigation or further processing of the claim.
12:54
12 minutes 54 seconds
If the proximate cost is not covered, they immediately they they don't analyze much when they recheck the claim.
