Go ahead.
26:20
26 minutes 20 seconds
All right.
26:20
26 minutes 20 seconds
So we talked about agents and brokers.
26:24
26 minutes 24 seconds
Aggregators are like you might have heard of policybazaar.com.
26:32
26 minutes 32 seconds
Similarly, in the US there are aggregators who are not insurance companies, but they are online information providers for people who search on insurance products.
26:46
26 minutes 46 seconds
They provide the information.
26:48
26 minutes 48 seconds
Suppose you search for vehicle insurance.
26:51
26 minutes 51 seconds
You you land into policybazaar.com and if you get into policybazaar.com, they capture certain minimum information from you.
26:59
26 minutes 59 seconds
So what is your vehicle make, model and year?
27:02
27 minutes 2 seconds
And your location?
27:04
27 minutes 4 seconds
Your pin code or zip code?
27:07
27 minutes 7 seconds
With that they'll be able to get the quotes insurance quotation from several insurance companies.
27:16
27 minutes 16 seconds
So they have tie up with multiple insurance companies.
27:18
27 minutes 18 seconds
They pass on this basic information from you to all the insurance companies who are partnered with policybazaar.com and they get you the premium, estimated premium, it is not accurate but estimated premium so.
27:35
27 minutes 35 seconds
So when you select one and go into the specific insurance companies website there you you you will be asked further more questions and then the final premium will be calculated and you can buy the insurance policy online.
27:48
27 minutes 48 seconds
So aggregators are people who facilitate in giving you the insurance quotation and enable you to buy and buy a policy online or at least guide you to the lowest you know you they're giving you options of the quotes from multiple insurance companies.
28:09
28 minutes 9 seconds
So they they both aggregators, brokers as well as agents.
28:14
28 minutes 14 seconds
All of them are entitled to a Commission from insurance company.
28:19
28 minutes 19 seconds
They don't take any Commission from insured but they take Commission from insurance company.
28:26
28 minutes 26 seconds
Then the final is the Tele sales, telecallers Tele sales.
28:30
28 minutes 30 seconds
So they are either employees of the insurance company or outsource the team who sell the products of insurance company over phone.
28:41
28 minutes 41 seconds
All right.
28:41
28 minutes 41 seconds
And on the customer perspective, we have insured, you know we may we also have claimant and beneficiaries.
28:48
28 minutes 48 seconds
So who is a claimant?
28:51
28 minutes 51 seconds
Claimant could be the insured or the insured.
28:56
28 minutes 56 seconds
Unfortunately dice their family member could be the claimant.
29:03
29 minutes 3 seconds
Oh sorry, Family member could be the beneficiary.
29:06
29 minutes 6 seconds
Claimant is someone.
29:09
29 minutes 9 seconds
It was a third party.
29:10
29 minutes 10 seconds
It could either be the policy holder who is suffering damages or sometimes it could be the third party who is suffering damages because of the insurance activity.
29:19
29 minutes 19 seconds
So claimant can be either insured or a third party.
29:23
29 minutes 23 seconds
Beneficiary.
29:23
29 minutes 23 seconds
Beneficiary is family of the insured or the nominee of the insured who is eligible to receive the claim amount in the case of death of the insured.
29:36
29 minutes 36 seconds
So I hope you are clear with these terminologies.

30:23
30 minutes 23 seconds

30 minutes 39 seconds
So Underwriters are employees of insurance company who receives your application, verifies the access, does the assessment and then take a decision whether to accept the risk or reject the risk.
