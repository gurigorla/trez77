ing to buy a vehicle or a house, the dealer gives you a quote.
0:29
0 minutes 29 seconds
Similarly insurance based on information gathered, a quote will be created and that we shared through the agent or directly to the prospect the person who's going to take insurance.
0:39
0 minutes 39 seconds
And if the person is convinced or happy with the quoted benefits quoted price, then they would agree and then the final policy will be issued.
0:51
0 minutes 51 seconds
So that's the process.
0:52
0 minutes 52 seconds
However, insurance policy is also being issued.
0:56
0 minutes 56 seconds
So initially, before the quote is being issued, they we collect basic information about the prospect, about the property.
1:05
1 minute 5 seconds
And as I said, there's a questioner given in the application form the that has to be filled in by the prospect that will help the underwriters to decide whether to accept the risk or reject the risk.
1:18
1 minute 18 seconds
For example, a house that has a building, a garage, three dogs and four cats, suspect animals and a swimming pool and a trampoline.
13:51
13 minutes 51 seconds
The owner owns the property but he or she does not live in the property lives in a different building.
13:58
13 minutes 58 seconds
In that case they buy a rental property.
14:00
14 minutes
Insurance.
14:01
14 minutes 1 second
They can cover only the building because they do not own the contents they own only the building.
14:07
14 minutes 7 seconds
OK, property owner takes the the renter's tenant can take this policy and tenant will live in the house temporarily.
14:14
14 minutes 14 seconds
Tenant does not own the building.
14:16
14 minutes 16 seconds
So tenant can own can can ensure only the contents BPP.
14:23
14 minutes 23 seconds
As I told you it's a list of valuable items scheduled list of valuable items one by one.
14:29
14 minutes 29 seconds
Each item will be supposed jewelry.
14:32
14 minutes 32 seconds
Each item of the jewelry will be mentioned and value of the jewelry will be piece of jewelry will be mentioned for which premium will be calculated.
14:41
14 minutes 41 seconds
So since everything is individually mentioned, we call that as a schedule and whatever value is mentioned over there that will be paid during the time of claim.
14:52
14 minutes 52 seconds
So the contents said above also covers valuables but there is a lower limit there.
14:58
14 minutes 58 seconds
There is a cap, OK, it cannot exceed say a blank value.
15:03
15 minutes 3 seconds
Blanket value of say $2500 will be allowed for contents, but in VPP you can cover up to the Max actual value of all the jewelry, all the valuables that you have in your house.
15:18
15 minutes 18 seconds
And as I told you, VPP also helps in world provides worldwide coverage whether you carry it to your office or carry it to your Interstate travel or international travel.
15:30
15 minutes 30 seconds
Your policy covers your valuables when you're when you're carrying with you.
15:37
15 minutes 37 seconds
So watercraft, we talked about it, it covers the watercraft, the boat and its machinery.
15:43
15 minutes 43 seconds
Medical payments are covered liabilities also covered umbrella provides higher liability limits and wider coverage.
15:52
15 minutes 52 seconds
Liability limits over and above property and auto policy will be covered in umbrella.
15:57
15 minutes 57 seconds
Who can take a property owner or an auto owner can take umbrella policy?
16:02
16 minutes 2 seconds
Any doubts?
16:02
16 minutes 2 seconds
Any questions in this slide?
16:11
16 minutes 11 seconds
OK, there are a few more other products or other logs.
16:16
16 minutes 16 seconds
Travel insurance provides all the coverages that are required when you travel.
16:25
16 minutes 25 seconds
So you you may require health insurance during a travel, you may require coverage to your baggage that you carry.
16:34
16 minutes 34 seconds
Sometimes your baggage may be lost, your passport may be lost.
16:38
16 minutes 38 seconds
So if you take, if those are covered under travel insurance, as long as you're you're away from your home and on your trip, you will be covered.
16:49
16 minutes 49 seconds
From the time your travel starts and the from the and to the till the time you return, your travel insurance will be effective flood insurance.
17:01
17 minutes 1 second
We talked about it mostly it is state, state, insurance department or national.
17:07
17 minutes 7 seconds
The federal insurance department will sponsor or will provide this coverage.
17:14
17 minutes 14 seconds
Catastrophic class coverages like flood, earthquake and stuff and terrorism.
17:21
17 minutes 21 seconds
OK, so these are the products that are issued by USA.
17:26
17 minutes 26 seconds
These are other products which members may request for but USA do not offer these products.
17:34
17 minutes 34 seconds
So they enable these through by getting coverages from other insurance companies and providing it for their members.
17:44
17 minutes 44 seconds
So who does that?
17:46
17 minutes 46 seconds
There is a team within USA called USA Agency.
17:52
17 minutes 52 seconds
So this agency or agency team or they have a company called Agent USA Agency.
18:00
18 minutes
They will do this, you know getting the required products from outside market and offering it to their members.
18:10
18 minutes 10 seconds
If we go through, if members go through US it why can't members go directly to other insurance companies?
8:16
18 minutes 16 seconds
But USA does that service and people who make use of members who make use of that service get a 5% additional discount rather than going directly to external insurance company.
18:28
18 minutes 28 seconds
So why do they do all of these?
18:30
18 minutes 30 seconds
In order to retain their members as a service to their members, they try to sell these products.
18:36
18 minutes 36 seconds
I mean to decide to get these products from other insurance companies and for their members.
18:45
18 minutes 45 seconds
This slide talks about some examples of additional coverages.
41:52
41 minutes 52 seconds
So the cost that is required to completely rebuild the home from scratch, replacing the carpet, furniture, appliances and personal belongings will be considered as insurance to value.
42:05
42 minutes 5 seconds
And this is the best price for which we can take insurance.
42:08
42 minutes 8 seconds
Otherwise, most often what happens in property insurance, the common challenge is people buy insurance but they buy for a lower value, OK that would lead to under insurance.
42:21
42 minutes 21 seconds
If then accident occurs, they are paid only less.
42:25
42 minutes 25 seconds
Only at that point in time people regret oh I should have taken value for ITV.
42:32
42 minutes 32 seconds
So it is always good to take insurance for the right value and what is the right value?
42:37
42 minutes 37 seconds
ITV is the right value and how do I know my ITV value?
42:44
42 minutes 44 seconds
My experts like exact where MSB would be able to calculate that for me.
42:51
42 minutes 51 seconds
OK, so lastly smart home or IoT.
43:00
43 minutes
So we talked about it, Smart devices are installed in the house in order to detect any loss and prevent the loss or even if the loss occurs, it to keep it, to control it and to keep it at the minimum level.
43:16
43 minutes 16 seconds
So house owners who install smart devices in their houses, they get a discounted premium all right.
43:27
43 minutes 27 seconds
So these detectors will share data to the.
43:34
43 minutes 34 seconds
So the vendors say that if if a company ABC sells the devices, they are able to capture the data from these devices and insurance company receives those data.
43:48
43 minutes 48 seconds
So that to study what is the risk exposure for that house property and also to monitor vendor levels of say if it is wind detector, wind speed detector, the level of wind is increasing then insurance company will.
44:07
44 minutes 7 seconds
If the if it is increasing beyond a certain threshold level, insurance company will notify the policy holder wherever the policy holder.
44:15
44 minutes 15 seconds
The policy holder might have been traveling or in the office 50 kilometers away.
44:21
44 minutes 21 seconds
So they will be able to inform the owners beforehand by seeing the data in from the coming from the smart devices.
44:30
44 minutes 30 seconds
Is that clear, team?
44:33
44 minutes 33 seconds
All right, so we come to the end of this session.
44:43
44 minutes 43 seconds
Any questions so far on property?
44:48
44 minutes 48 seconds
No questions.
44:55
44 minutes 55 seconds
